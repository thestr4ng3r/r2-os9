# r2-os9

Basic radare2 bin plugin to read Microware OS-9 memory modules.

Created after the OS-9 2.4 Technical Manual, which is the one that applies to CD-RTOS, the operating system of Philips CD-i consoles.

Working features:
* Parsing header and additional header values (see `i` and `ih`)
* Sections for header, body and crc (`iS`)
* Entrypoint (`ie`)

## Building and Installing

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make && sudo make install
```
Run `make install` without `sudo` if you installed radare2 in your user's directory.
